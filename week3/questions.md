## What property makes a discrete type more specialized than a scalar type

Discrete types are a specialisation of scalar types in Ada. Each value of a discrete
type has a position number which is an integer, whereas a real types (the other specialisation of a scalar type),
support floating-point or fixed-point numbers. Scalar types and access types encompass all elementary types of Ada.
